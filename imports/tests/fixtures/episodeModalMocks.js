    "Sometimes success will come to you from the strangest places. It may seem like your passions won’t pay off, but if you push through and continue to grow you’ll find a way to have it work.\r\nIt won’t be easy, and there will be plenty of times you’ll want to give up. It may even seem like the smart thing to do. But if you want to feel fulfilled and happy, it can’t be about the money.\r\nIt has to be about the love of what you do, and trust that the money will come later.\r\nThe perfect example of this comes from today’s guest, Tony Hawk.\r\nI used to love watching Tony Hawk on the X Games. He was an instant legend, and an icon in something that no one saw as a sport when he started out. In fact, learning a new trick was frowned upon when he was starting out.\r\nToday, today is one of the most respected athletes there is. He’s a household name and continues to push the boundaries.",
